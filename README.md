Hey there! In 2024 I created a fun little chess bot that played chess against me. I am recoding and uploading it now! 
Improvements underway:

-- Replace min max algorithm and piece value assignment with a neural network evaluation model

-- Rework current piece movement using bitboards



All you need to do is install pip or activate a virtual environment, then install python-chess

# Create and Activate Virtual Environment
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install packages
pip install python-chess
pip install chess
pip install flask
#pip install flask-cors

# Run it
app.py

# Deactivate the virtual machine
deactivate
